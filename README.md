## Description 

The inital code shows a website for a marketing agency that was unoptimized and lacked accessibility for a variety of clients visiting the web page.
This project focusing on refactoring the exisiting code to add accessibility options and re-structure code to improve the functionality. 
To do so HTML was added to make sure all links were working as intended. HTML was added with the intent to make the website viewable on mobile phones. Alternative attributes were added to the exisiting images to improve accessability and optimized for search engines.
CSS was re-structured to follow the flow of the HTML and classes were consolidated to apply styling to multiple elements. Comments have been added to the CSS file to explain the functionality of the code to other developers who access the code in the future.
